The dataset includes 1569 images.
ObjectDetectionBelt-Quality are annotated in YOLOv11 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 1280x1280 (Fill (with center crop))
* Grayscale (CRT phosphor)

The following augmentation was applied to create 3 versions of each source image:
* Random shear of between -5° to +5° horizontally and -5° to +5° vertically
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -20 and 0 percent
* Random Gaussian blur of between 0 and 1.5 pixels
* Salt and pepper noise was applied to 1.05 percent of pixels
